    "# QUES.1 What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "# ANSWER Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique used in regression analysis, particularly when dealing with \n",
    "# datasets where there are many features (variables) and some of these features are highly correlated. It combines penalties\n",
    "# from both Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization) regression methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Differences from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Lasso Regression: Lasso tends to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. However, when\n",
    "# there are highly correlated features, Lasso tends to arbitrarily select one feature over the others. Elastic Net addresses\n",
    "# this limitation by combining Lasso and Ridge penalties, providing a balance between them.\n",
    "# 2. Ridge Regression: Ridge regression reduces the impact of less relevant features by shrinking their coefficients towards\n",
    "# zero. However, it doesn't perform feature selection, meaning it won't drive coefficients to exactly zero. Elastic Net, \n",
    "# by combining Lasso and Ridge penalties, performs both shrinkage and feature selection.\n",
    "# 3. Linear Regression: Linear regression doesn't have any regularization; it simply minimizes the sum of squared differences \n",
    "# between the observed and predicted values. Elastic Net introduces regularization to combat overfitting and multicollinearity\n",
    "# issues in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, Elastic Net Regression is a powerful tool when dealing with datasets containing many features, especially when\n",

    "# QUES.2 How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "# ANSWER Choosing the optimal values for the regularization parameters in Elastic Net Regression involves a balance between\n",
    "# the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. Here's a general approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Cross-validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate different combinations of the regularization \n",
    "# parameters. This involves splitting your dataset into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and validating on the\n",
    "# remaining subset. Repeat this process k times, rotating which subset is held out each time, and average the results.\n",
    "# 2. Grid search: Define a grid of values for both the L1 and L2 penalties. For example, you could define a grid for alpha \n",
    "# (the overall regularization strength) and another grid for the ratio of L1 to L2 penalty (the l1_ratio). Then, iterate\n",
    "# through all combinations of these values and evaluate each combination using cross-validation.\n",
    "# 3. Scoring metric: Choose an appropriate scoring metric for evaluation during cross-validation. Common choices include mean\n",
    "# squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared. Choose the metric that best aligns with your problem and \n",
    "# objectives.\n",
    "# 4. Select the best parameters: After evaluating all combinations, choose the combination of parameters that yields the best\n",
    "# performance on your chosen scoring metric.\n",
    "# 5. Refinement: Depending on the size of your grid search and computational resources, you may choose to refine your search\n",
    "# around the best-performing parameters. This could involve narrowing the range of values or increasing the resolution of \n",
    "# the grid in the vicinity of the best parameters found so far.\n",
    "# 6. Final model: Once you have determined the optimal parameters, train the final Elastic Net Regression model using all\n",
    "# available data with those parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remember that the optimal values of the regularization parameters may depend on the specific characteristics of your\n",
    "# dataset, so it's essential to validate your choice using techniques like cross-validation.\n"
